    "\n",
    "1. **Danceability:** The mean danceability score of 0.6547 indicates that, on average, the tracks in the dataset tend to have a relatively high danceability. This suggests that the majority of tracks are suitable for dancing and have a rhythmic quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Valence:** The mean valence score of 0.4973 suggests a moderate positive valence across the tracks. This indicates that the tracks in the dataset generally convey a positive or uplifting mood.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loudness:** The wide range of loudness values indicates significant variations in volume levels among the tracks. This suggests that the dataset includes both softer and louder tracks, providing a diverse listening experience in terms of loudness.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Energy:** With a mean energy score of 0.6569, the dataset exhibits a balanced distribution between energetic and mellow tracks. This indicates a mix of high-energy and more subdued tracks, catering to different listener preferences."

    "##### Interpretation based on Histogram :\n",
    "Based on above histograms, we can make the following interpretations regarding the relationship between audio features and track popularity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Danceability:** The histogram of danceability reveals the distribution of danceability scores across the tracks. It shows the frequency of tracks at different danceability levels. As the histogram is skewed towards higher danceability scores, it suggests that a significant number of popular tracks in the dataset are highly danceable. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Energy:** The energy histogram displays the distribution of energy levels in the dataset. It provides insights into the frequency of tracks with different energy characteristics. As histogram is skewed towards higher energy levels, it suggests that a substantial portion of the tracks are energetic and high-intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loudness:** The loudness histogram shows the distribution of loudness levels in the tracks. It indicates the frequency of tracks at different volume levels. As histogram is skewed towards higher loudness values suggests that a significant number of popular tracks are loud or have higher volume levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Valence:** The valence histogram represents the distribution of valence scores among the tracks. It shows the frequency of tracks with different levels of positivity or mood. As histogram with a more balanced distribution across valence scores, it indicates a diverse range of moods in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Tempo:** The tempo histogram illustrates the distribution of tempo values in the tracks. It displays the frequency of tracks at different tempos. A histogram is with more even distribution across tempo values, this indicates a diverse range of tempos in the dataset."
